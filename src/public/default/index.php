        <h1>Welcome to Onionimbus!</h1>
        <p>
            This server is a node in an Onionimbus cluster. For more on the Onionimbus project,
            please refer to the Wiki on our GitHub repositories:

        <h2>What is Onionimbus?</h2>
        <p>
            Onionimbus is a network of hot-swappable reverse proxies for Tor Hidden Services, and
            is a departure from the tor2web project in two significant ways:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                We do not alter/censor any web pages that are proxied. (No additional headers or disclaimers.)
            </li>
            <li>
                We allow users who interface with our hub to specify a hostname (e.g. `example.com`)
                and Hidden Service address (e.g. `examplehiddensv.onion`) pair.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>What You're Doing is Illegal</h2>
        <p>
            Only if your country does not have any constitutional protections for free speech.
        </p>
        <p>
            The person who operates this reverse proxy has no control over the material transmitted
            through it. For more information, please refer to the following educational documentation:
